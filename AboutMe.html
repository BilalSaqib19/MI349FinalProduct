My name is Bilal Saqib and I am a student at MSU. I am currently enrolled in the games and interactive media major. I have two older brothers, which means ever since I can remember, I've had a controller in my hands. Some of my favorite games of all time are Halo 3 ODST, Paper Mario, and Chronotrigger. My love for creating games orignally began when I made maps for my friends to play in either Halo forge or Minecraft Creative mode. I spent hundreds of hours making maps and mini games for my friends to enjoy. I realised that I enjoyed making these maps just as much as playing them with friends. Seeing my maps spring to life when my friends interacted with it gave me joy. I am pursuing video game design because I love making people smile. Games are a medium unlike other entertainment. They are not static, they interact with the user.
