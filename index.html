<h4 class="gameTitle"> A Slime Goes To Vegas</h4>
<p class="gameText">A slime goes to Vegas is a game about the lovable slime, Mitch! In 1977 NASA launched photos and music into space in hopes of reaching extraterrestrial life. One of those photos included the beautiful Eiffel Tower <img src="Mitch.png" alt="Picture Of the Lovable Slime Mitch"  class="mitch">. Mitch, a slime alien from a far away galaxy, hopes to meet the Tower in person. Mitch has never seen Earth before but hopes to spread its cheer to everything it touches. Equiped with a cheery smile, "say hi", to everything around you and get large enough to meet the Eiffel Tower! My role for this 3D game jam was designer and producer. I created each section though probuilder and progrids. After that I established a list of scripts, models, and UI art for the rest of the team to work on. I also had my hand in some programming for the UI. </p>
