           Awsum Pawsum was the February Spartasoft Game Jam from Team Birdo. This time around I brought 8 other people to join me on this project. I was the producer and designer for this project. I utilized google docs to create and effective way to communicate what sections of the game needed to be worked on. While working on this project I got a handle on what everyone was capable of doing, this let me effectively know the scope of what we could achieve in 48 hours. While doing this project multiple different ideas were thrown together to create a small gameplay loop.  
           This game jam game helped me a lot with getting experience in producing. (Click on the image to play the game on Itch.io!)
